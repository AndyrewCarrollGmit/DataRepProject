#Singe Page Web-Application
<h3> Python-Flask Project 2016 </h3>
<p> This Repository contains code written in the programming language Python and the markup langauge HTML for a third year project in the module <b> Data Representation and Querying</b> <p> 
<h4> The Project Brief: </h4>
           You are required to develop a single-page web application (SPA) written
           in the programming language Python  using the Flask framework.
           You must devise an idea for a web application, write the software, write
           documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user
           guide for it 
<h4> What Is The Application </h4>          
<p> For my Project I decided to create a <b>password generator</b>. The application asks a user to choose the length of he/shes password with a drop-down menu & incorporates both lower and uppercase letters with numbers, allowing for a more powerful and less hackable password. The User can give feedback and submit the feedback using their email address which will then be stored in an SQLite Database <p>  
<h4> Where the Application was created: </h4>
<p> The Project was written in the program PyCharm,  an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language<p>
