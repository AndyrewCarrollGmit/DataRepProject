#Singe Page Web-Application
<h3> Python-Flask Project 2016 </h3>
<p> This Repository contains code written in the programming language Python and the markup langauge HTML for a third year project in the module <b> Data Representation and Querying <p> 
<h4> The Project Brief: </h4>
          You are required to develop a single-page web application (SPA) written
           in the programming language Python  using the Flask framework.
           You must devise an idea for a web application, write the software, write
           documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user
           guide for it 
          
<p> For my Project I decdided to create a password generator. The application allows a user to choose the length of he/shes password themselves incorpoating both lower and uppercase letters with numbers, allowing for a more powerful and less hackable password <p>
