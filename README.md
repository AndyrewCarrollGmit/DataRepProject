#Singe Page Web-Application
<h3><b> Python-Flask Project 2016 </b></h3>
<p> This Repository contains code written in the programming language Python and the markup langauge HTML for a third year project in the module <b> Data Representation and Querying</b> <p> 
<h4> The Project Brief: </h4>
           You are required to develop a single-page web application (SPA) written
           in the programming language Python  using the Flask framework.
           You must devise an idea for a web application, write the software, write
           documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user
           guide for it 
           
<h3><b> Picking The Project </b> </h3>
<p> The first few weeks were spent researching up on flask and python and different projects that have been created using them,during my  research  I narrowed my rearch down to 3 <p>
           
           1.Password Generator
           2.Grades Calulator
           3.Bit-Coin Converter
 <p> In the end I decided on the <b> password generator </b> As I found some great and helpful tutorials online <p>            
           
 <h3><b> What Is The Application </b> </h3>          
<p> For my Project I decided to create a <b>password generator</b>. The application asks a user to choose the length of he/shes password with a drop-down menu & incorporates both lower and uppercase letters with numbers, allowing for a more powerful and less hackable password. The User can give feedback and submit the feedback using their email address which will then be stored in an SQLite Database <p>  

<h3>><b> Where the Application was created </b></h3>
<p> The Project was written in the program PyCharm, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language here i wrote my python and html code along with the css and javascript,  and when running the python project I used the Console Emulator <b>cmder</b> <p>
           
     Both of Which Downloaded From: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
                                    http://cmder.net/
<p> In order to get flask working with pycharm an extension was downloaded inside the program, New Boston Tutorials on youtube has a video showing how to set this up <p>
                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVGwqnjOKjk

<h3><b> How to Run the Application</b> </h3>
<p>When Running the project make sure  you direct the cmder to the right directory <p>
           There you will be able to run the application with the following command :
           py DataRepProject.py 
           
           
<p>Once the Application is running you will be given a url to run in your browser:<p>
                      http://127.0.0.1:5000/

 <h3><b> Conclusion</b> </h3>
  <p> Looking Back On the project theres a few things that I would have changed and done alot better, for example when it comes to sending feedback to the database for SQLite it is not fully working, I looked at different database softwares such as CouchDB but I found that there was alot more material on SQLite so decided to work with that for my project, Overall I am happy with  my application and believe it is very user friendly to use with little and basic options in order to complete the task at hand.<p>
